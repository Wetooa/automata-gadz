# Automata Visualizer

Welcome to the **Automata Visualizer**, an interactive sandbox designed to help students and enthusiasts explore the fascinating world of formal languages and automata theory. Whether you're learning about regular expressions, finite automata, or Turing machines, this tool empowers you to visualize and experiment with key concepts, making complex topics more intuitive and engaging.

## üéØ Purpose

This project aims to:

1. Enhance the learning experience for students of formal languages and automata theory.
2. Provide upcoming 3rd-year students of Cebu Institute of Technology University with a hands-on tool to complement their coursework.
3. Serve as a personal challenge to improve my software development skills and contribute to open-source learning tools.

## ‚ú® Features

### Midterm Topics

- **Regular Expressions (Regex):** Build and visualize regex patterns, test strings, and see how they are matched.
- **Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA):** Create DFAs and watch them process input strings step-by-step.
- **Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA):** Experiment with NFAs and understand how they differ from DFAs.

### Finals Topics

- **Context-Free Grammars (CFG):** Define grammars, generate strings, and parse inputs.
- **Pushdown Automata (PDA):** Visualize PDAs and their stack-based operations.
- **Turing Machines:** Design Turing machines, simulate computations, and explore the limits of computability.

### General Features

- **Interactive Sandbox:** Drag-and-drop interface for building automata and grammars.
- **Step-by-Step Simulation:** Visualize the processing of inputs at every step.
- **Debugging Tools:** Identify errors in automata, grammars, and expressions.
- **Educational Insights:** Inline explanations and tips to reinforce understanding.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** [React.js/Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for a modern and responsive user interface.
- **Backend:** Node.js or Python for processing automata and grammars.
- **Visualization:** D3.js or Canvas API for interactive diagrams.
- **Testing Frameworks:** Jest or Mocha for unit and integration testing.
